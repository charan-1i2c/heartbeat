# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

[**Live Demo → heartdisease‑predictor‑31.streamlit.app**](https://heartdisease-predictor-31.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a simple and intuitive web app built with **Streamlit + Python + scikit‑learn** to predict the likelihood of heart disease, given some basic medical parameters (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, etc.). It uses a trained logistic‑regression model on a publicly available “heart disease” dataset to output a clear prediction:

- ✅ **No Heart Disease Risk**  
- 🛑 **High Risk of Heart Disease**

Use this to quickly check risk based on patient data — no installation, just open the link and fill in the form!

## 🧠 Why it matters

Heart disease remains one of the leading health concerns worldwide. Early detection and preventive assessment can make a big difference. This app aims to:

- Offer a **quick risk‑assessment tool** using basic patient information  
- Enable users (doctors, patients, enthusiasts) to **explore heart‑disease likelihood without needing ML expertise**  
- Serve as a **learning/demo project** for how to deploy machine‑learning models using Streamlit
